# Bloom Browser v1.0
## What it does:
Bloom is a very basic web browser that can only search the web and go back or forward. It uses Ecosia as its search engine, although, only if you use the Ecosia search bar. My future hopes for the project are to develop it as a fully functional web browser with custom features as well as make it into its own Android app.
## Technologies used:
The browser was built with Python using PyQt5 in Visual Studio Code.
## Why said technologies:
I decided to use Python because I wanted to expand my experience with the language and because it's my preferred language to write code in. PyQt5 was used because it has the functionality needed for the project.
## How to install it:
First, you need to create and activate a virtual environment for the project. If you don't know how to do that, you can follow this tutorial by *teclado*: https://youtu.be/KxvKCSwlUv8. After that, you have to install all of the requirements for the project in the *requirements.txt* file by executing the following command: *pip install -r requirements.txt*. The last step is to run the *app.py* file by entering *python app.py* in the terminal.
## How to use it:
The browser is very easy to use. You can either use the Ecosia search bar or type the URL you want to go to in the top bar. If you leave out the *https://* at the start, the browser will automatically fill it in after you press the *Search* button. Once you've entered a website, you can either go back by pressing the *<* button or go forward by pressing *>*. Notice, you can only go forward if you've gone back first. It is important to note that pressing *Enter* while in the browser's search bar does not work.
